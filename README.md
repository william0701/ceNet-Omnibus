# CeNet Omnibus
## Introduction
The ceRNA regulation is a newly discovered post-transcriptional regulation mechanism and plays significant roles in physiological and pathological progress. The analysis of ceRNAs and ceRNA network has been widely used to detect survival biomarkers, select candidate regulators of disease genes, and pre-dict long noncoding RNA functions. However, there is no software platform to provide overall functions from construction to analysis of ceRNA networks. To solve this problem, we introduce CeNet Omnibus, a R/Shiny application, which provides a unified framework of ceRNA network construction and analysis. CeNet Omnibus is characterized by comprehensiveness, high efficiency, high expandability and user customizability, and it also offers the web-based user-friendly interface for users to obtain the output intuitionally in time.
CeNet Omnibus consists of five components, including **Data Input**, **Data Processing**, **Network Construction**, **Network Visualization** and **Netwoek Analysis**. The framework of CeNet Omnibus is shown below.
